 ## Download
       Training images can be downloaded here{"https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html"}.
       Testing images can be downloaded here.
       A devkit, including class labels for training images and bounding boxes for all images, can be downloaded here.
       If you're interested in the BMW-10 dataset, you can get that here.

       Update: For ease of development, a tar of all images is available here and all bounding boxes and labels for both training and test are available here. If you were using the evaluation server before (which is still running), you can use test annotations here to evaluate yourself without using the server.
